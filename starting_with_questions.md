Answer the following questions and provide the SQL queries used to find the answer.

    
**Question 1: Which cities and countries have the highest level of transaction revenues on the site?**


SQL Queries:

```sql
SELECT SUM(transaction_revenue), country, city FROM cleaned_all_sessions GROUP BY country, city ORDER BY SUM(transaction_revenue) DESC, country, city 
 ```

Answer:

The cities with the highest level of transaction revenues on the site are the United States and the two cities of Sunnyval and (Not available in demo dataset).

**Question 2: What is the average number of products ordered from visitors in each city and country?**


SQL Queries:

```sql
SELECT AVG(product_quantity), country, city FROM cleaned_all_sessions WHERE product_quantity IS NOT NULL GROUP BY country, city ORDER BY AVG(product_quantity) DESC, country, city 
 ```

**Question 3: Is there any pattern in the types (product categories) of products ordered from visitors in each city and country?**


SQL Queries:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(v2product_category), v2product_category, country, city FROM cleaned_all_sessions WHERE v2product_category IS NOT NULL GROUP BY country, city, v2product_category ORDER BY COUNT(v2product_category) DESC, country, city 
```

Answer:
Yes, there are patterns in the types (product categories) of products ordered from visitors in each city and country:

### Top 3 product categorys by country:

### United States

**Question 4: What is the top-selling product from each city/country? Can we find any pattern worthy of noting in the products sold?**

SQL Queries:

This query will show the top selling product in each city/country combination.
```sql
SELECT country, city, v2product_name, product_count,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY country ORDER BY product_count DESC) AS rank
FROM (
    SELECT country, city, v2product_name, COUNT(v2product_name) AS product_count
    FROM cleaned_all_sessions
    GROUP BY country, city, v2product_name
) AS subquery
WHERE country != '(not set)' AND country!= '(not set)' and city != ('not available in demo dataset')
ORDER BY country, rank;
```
This query will show the top selling product in each different country not accounting for cities.
```sql
SELECT country, v2product_name, product_count, rank
FROM (
    SELECT country, v2product_name, COUNT(v2product_name) AS product_count,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY country ORDER BY COUNT(v2product_name) DESC) AS rank
    FROM cleaned_all_sessions
    GROUP BY country, v2product_name
) AS subquery
WHERE rank = 1 AND country != '(not set)'
ORDER BY product_count desc
```

Answer:
Examining the the top-selling product from each city/country, a pattern worth noting the products sold is that the United States has the most of any one product being sold compared to every other country.


**Question 5: Can we summarize the impact of revenue generated from each city/country?**

SQL Queries:

This query will show the total revenue generated by each city/country combination.
``` sql
SELECT country, city, SUM(total_transaction_revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM cleaned_all_sessions
GROUP BY country, city
HAVING SUM(total_transaction_revenue) > 0
ORDER BY country, city;
```

Answer:
Yes, we can summarize the impact of revenue generated from each city/country.
