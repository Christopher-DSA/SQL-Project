# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
My goal with this final project is to put all my SQL skills to the test and continue to learn more during the project.

## Process
### (your step 1)
First I loaded all the csv files into a new data base called ecommerece/
### (your step 2)
Then I reviewed the data and skimmed through to see what kind of information was within each column. I also spent time looking for any dirty data.
### (your step 3)
Next, I started working on creating queries to clean the data. Once I was done I created a new clean version of each table, keeping the old ones as backup temporaily.
### (your step 4)
Next, I started answering the 5 questions in part 3 using SQL queries.
### (your step 5)
Finally I did QA on my data and identified risk areas by running queries to validate the accuracy of my results in parts 3 and 4.
## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
Learning to understand the buisness process soley through the data I received in the CSV files was an interesting experience. This was helpful learning experience.
## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
