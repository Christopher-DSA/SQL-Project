# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
This project is an analysis of the ecommerce dataset that comes from an online store and the documentation of that process from start to finish.

My goal with this final project is to put all my SQL skills to the test and continue to learn more during the project.

## Process
### (Step 1)
First I loaded all the csv files into a newdata base called ecommerce using pgadmin4.
### (Step 2)
Then I reviewed the data in the tables to see what kind of information was within each column. I also spent time looking for any dirty data.
### (Step 3)
Next, I started working on creating queries to clean the data. Once I was done I created a new clean version of each table, keeping the old ones as backup temporaily.
### (Step 4)
Next, I started answering the 5 questions in part 3 using SQL queries.
### (Step 5)
Finally I did QA on my data and identified risk areas by running queries to validate the accuracy of my results in parts 3 and 4.

## Results
I discovered this data could tell me a lot about the demographic, revenue and products customers were purchasing on the website the data came from.
I learned that the website had 14,223 unique visitors, most of which came from the United States.
The most revenue was generated by visitors From the United States.

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
Learning to understand the buisness process of the website through the data I received in the CSV files was an interesting experience.

Data type divison was an unexpected challenge in this project. I created a query to calculate the percentage of customers who visited website and also made a purchase but I would always get the result of 0. The issues was that the data I was dividing was the big int data type. After casting to the numeric type I got the expected result.
## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
If I  had more time, even though I spent 4 hours cleaning the data I would spend a little bit more time double checking everything to make sure I removed all the dirty data.
Another thing I would have done if I had more time is implementing more QA when running me queries. I did QA some of my queries but I didin't get the chance to practice QA on all of them.
