# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
This project is analysis of the ecommerce dataset that comes from an online store and the documentation of the process from start to finish.

My goal with this final project is to put all my SQL skills to the test and continue to learn more during the project.

## Process
### (Step 1)
First I loaded all the csv files into a new data base called ecommerece.
### (Step 2)
Then I reviewed the data and skimmed through to see what kind of information was within each column. I also spent time looking for any dirty data.
### (Step 3)
Next, I started working on creating queries to clean the data. Once I was done I created a new clean version of each table, keeping the old ones as backup temporaily.
### (Step 4)
Next, I started answering the 5 questions in part 3 using SQL queries.
### (Step 5)
Finally I did QA on my data and identified risk areas by running queries to validate the accuracy of my results in parts 3 and 4.
## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
Learning to understand the buisness process of the website through the data I received in the CSV files was an interesting experience.

Data type divison was an unexpected challenge in this project. I created a query to calculate the percentage of customers who visited website and also made a purchase but I would always get the result of 0. The issues was that the data I was dividing was the big int data type. After casting to the numeric type I got the expected result.
## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
If I  had more time, even though I spent 4 hours cleaning the data I would spend a little bit more time double checking everything to make sure I removed all the dirty data.
Another thing I would have done if I had more time is implementing more QA when running me queries. I did QA some of my queries but I didin't get the chance to practice QA on all of them.
